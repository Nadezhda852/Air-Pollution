     <span id="s2">Air pollution is a mix of particles and gases that can reach harmful concentrations both outside and indoors. 
         Its effects can range from higher disease risks to rising temperatures. Soot, smoke, mold, pollen, methane, 
         and carbon dioxide are a just few examples of common pollutants.</span><br>
    <span id="s3">Poor air quality kills people. Worldwide, bad outdoor air caused an estimated 4.2 million premature deaths in 2016, 
        about 90 percent of them in low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Health Organization. 
        Indoor smoke is an ongoing health threat to the 3 billion people who cook and heat their homes by burning biomass, 
        kerosene, and coal. Air pollution has been linked to higher rates of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory diseases
         such as asthma.</span>
