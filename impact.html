    <span id="s5">Though many living things emit carbon dioxide when they breathe, 
    the gas is widely considered to be a pollutant when associated with cars, planes, power plants, 
    and other human activities that involve the burning of fossil fuels such as gasoline and natural gas.
    That's because carbon dioxide is the most common of the greenhouse gases, 
    which trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to climate change. 
    Humans have pumped enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere over the past 150 years to raise its 
    levels higher than they have been for hundreds of thousands of years.</span>
